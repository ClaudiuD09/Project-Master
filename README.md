The use of the Godot 4 game engine was fundamental due to its robustness and flexibility,
allowing for the efficient resolution of encountered technical challenges. We overcame
minor export difficulties and managed to synchronize objects in the virtual environment, ensuring
a consistent and smooth experience for users. The implementation of communication
and data update algorithms allowed real-time synchronization of objects and their states,
highlighting the advanced capabilities of the application.

The main objective of the application was to demonstrate the distribution of a crossplatform
virtual environment, with a particular focus on user connectivity and object replication.
These objectives were successfully achieved, ensuring a coherent and interactive
experience for users. Although adapting a game initially designed in 2D to a 3D environment
presented significant challenges, we made important progress in this direction, laying
the groundwork for further developments.

Future development prospects for the application are promising and include the integration
of additional interactions and objects to create a more diverse and engaging environment.
These improvements include creating a dynamic environment with a larger number of NPCs
(non-player characters), adding a timer to compare user completion times, and introducing
innovative game mechanics. The integration of artificial intelligence could bring significant
improvements in NPC behavior, offering users a more realistic and complex interaction.

Additionally, future research will address optimizing Web platform connectivity and
fully integrating the 3D environment for virtual reality applications. Performance optimization
of the application on various platforms will be crucial to ensure a consistent and smooth
user experience. Continuous performance monitoring and user feedback integration will play
an essential role in the ongoing improvement of the application.
